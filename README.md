# Archiver (WIP)

This project's meant to be a way for me to archive websites. 

The aim is to archive screenshots, PDFs, and simplified articles (using Mozilla's Readability project).

# Dependencies

- [micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro) for node to create microservices
- [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) from Google to access headless Chrome
